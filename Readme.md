### Why I Made This
Seeing what a treasure trove of content Realm Academy has, I looked for a way to watch it on my Apple TV. Not finding one, I figured it would be a good opportunity to learn a bit about Apple TV development, as well as help others out who are also interested in watching Realm Academy content on their Apple TV.

## Installing On Your Apple TV

Instructions:
- Make sure you have [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) installed.
- Download and extract to `RealmAcademy` folder
